# Instacart Market Basket Analysis

This project performs market basket analysis on Instacart data to identify product associations and customer purchasing patterns. By analyzing customer transactions, we can uncover frequent itemsets and generate actionable insights for improving cross-selling and product recommendations.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:

- Analyze customer purchase behavior to find correlations between items.
- Use the Apriori algorithm to mine frequent itemsets and generate association rules.
- Visualize the results to help inform business strategies for product recommendations.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python**  
- **Pandas**  
- **NumPy**  
- **mlxtend** (for implementing the Apriori algorithm)  
- **Matplotlib** (for visualizations)

## Steps Involved

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**:  
   The Instacart dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to prepare it for analysis. This involves handling missing values, encoding transactions, and structuring the data to feed into the Apriori algorithm.

2. **Analysis & Visualization**:  
   Frequent itemsets and generated rules are analyzed and visualized using matplotlib to highlight important associations and potential recommendations.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/instacart-market-basket-analysis.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the main analysis script:  
   ```bash
   python market_basket_analysis.py
   ```

## Expected Outcomes

- A set of association rules that describe product relationships.
- Visualizations of the most frequently purchased items and their connections.

## Conclusion

This project provides valuable insights into customer purchasing behavior, helping businesses improve their marketing and recommendation strategies by identifying the products that are frequently bought together.
